# Mindari's Word Games

Mindari's Word Games is a tool to extract Wordle, etc... scores from a shared Discord channel. I named the tool after a bard I played at a D&D oneshot. Discord's docs suggested having a cute mascot, so I kept it around. The current version live is at https://wordgames.melvis.site/. 

For those hooking into the live version, just invite the bot to your channel from the site. Commands are not needed, but will come shortly.

For those looking to self-host a private version, clone this repo and run `go build` followed by `./mindari serve`.
