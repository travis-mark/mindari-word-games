# Mindari's Word Games

Mindari's Word Games is a tool to extract Wordle, etc... scores from a shared Discord channel.

    Usage:

        mindari-word-games <command> [arguments]

    The commands are:

        monitor     Periodically monitor a channel for posted scores
        rescan      Do a full rescan of a channel (in case of defects or edits)
        serve       Start a local webserver to show stats and a leaderboard
        stats       Print stats to standard output to use for custom graphs


I named the tool after a bard I played at a D&D oneshot. Discord's docs suggested having a cute mascot, so I kept it around.
